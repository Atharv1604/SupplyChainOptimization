# SupplyChainOptimization
This project aims to optimize supply chain operations by predicting the risk of late deliveries.
By leveraging machine learning models, we can identify orders that are at high risk of delays, allowing businesses to take proactive measures to mitigate these risks and optimize their supply chain processes.
