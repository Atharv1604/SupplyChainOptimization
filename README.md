# SupplyChainOptimization

This project aims to optimize supply chain operations by predicting the risk of late deliveries.

By leveraging machine learning models, we can identify orders that are at high risk of delays, allowing businesses to take proactive measures to mitigate these risks and optimize their supply chain processes.

1.Data Preprocessing: Pyspark is used for data handling and preprocessing 

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the data using the EDA notebooks to gain insights and identify patterns.

3.Model Building: Train machine learning models using the provided scripts and notebook.

4.Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations.
